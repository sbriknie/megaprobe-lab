# Research Goals

By being part of the MegapProbe Lab I aim to improve my research abilities and learn a new set of skills that will help me become better scientist.

# Additional Goals
- Learn how to hack like Humberto
- Learn how to juggle
  
# Weekly UPDATES (LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...)

### Week 8: (04-08/Mar)
- I FINALLY PULLED!!
- This week I am going to start reading a paper about a "better implamentation" using kmers https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101271
- Also I am going to work with Roberto trying to run more examples in diffhash using the polyester 

### Week 7: (25-01/Feb-Mar)
- I was dealing with a lot of jobs from the past week and could not do many progress

### Week 6: (18-22/Feb)
- I was studing for Abstract Algebra and Algorithms and didn't have time do anything else this week

### Week 5: (11-15/Feb)
- Angel took the the diffhash project and he will make it work with any data.

### Week 4: (4-8/Feb)
- I moved diffhash to Hulk because Humberto told that using R-Studio my life would be much better. Then when I started running the program and it suddently crashed and this happened:

-- Me: Professor, I think I broke something
-- Humberto: Let me see the code...
-- (10 seconds scrolling through the code)
-- Humberto: You are missing an "@." right there.
-- Everything started to run perfectly well.

### Week 3: (28-01/Jan-Feb)
- It's been a week trying to run diffhash but I haven't been able to make it run from tip to tail. I thought bioinformatics was a little bit easier ðŸ¤”

### Week 2: (21-25/Jan)
- Using the eelpondworkshop file in boqueron to run the escambron protocols in order to use real data in the program (diffhash) that our Benevolent dictator has created
- Trying to understant how diffhash works

### Week 1: (14-18/Jan)
- I am trying to set some order/priorities in my life
